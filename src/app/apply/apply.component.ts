Our goal is to celebrate, cultivate and advocate for the African and Caribbean culture in Huddersfield and beyond. We also aim to enhance the skills, display and participation of Masquerade troupes within Huddersfield and wider boroughs of Kirklees. These skills will be developed through skills-gap workshops focusing on the expertise of craft making, wire bending, foam shaping and working with mixed materials, feathers and trims. HACCT will employ skilled carnival design technicians who will lead, deliver and appraise the skill enhancing program(mes). The learnt skills will allow the masquerade leaders and their chosen models to create unique Caribbean themed costumes and showcase them at the carnival launch event scheduled to be held in spring 2020. Our 2020 event aspires to offer several genres of music of black origin at the Carnival celebrations held at Greenhead Park where the parade concludes. Genres will include soca & calypso, reggae & Dancehall, Soul & RNB, offered in arenas within and/or surrounding the park. The goal is to create a festival like atmosphere where most musical tastes can be satisfied, providing an event which can be enjoyed by all backgrounds. Huddersfield Carnival Management Committee desire to encourage the musical artistry and performances for youths aged 11 to 25 by offering a dedicated stage/platform at Greenhead park, where they can showcase their talent. This will all stem from a competition called Huddz Got Talent, where young people will participate in a talent show with a range of categories. The winners will have the opportunity to perform on a carnival float and/or the main stage. Artistes will also will also be chosen in line with the CMC Artistic policy ensuring inclusion and diversity is withheld whilst supporting young people to develop the quality of their musical skills. Finally, as part of our project and to maintain traditions and cultures, CMC aim to bring steel pan back to the heart of carnival. We have been lucky to identify instructors and some instruments that can be loaned for some workshops to develop steel band classes and workshops in the community as well as looking into developing projects with schools to develop clubs to teach children learn how to play steel pan and its history. These workshops will initially be aimed at children aged 9 to 14 and we hope to have a schools panorama in the lead up to the event and have the winners perform on stage. Overall our project aim is to encourage participation for all age groups either as spectators, participants, stakeholders and/or organisers and ensure the tradition and legacy of carnival can continue in Huddersfield.";

Engage with young people to channel their energy into more positive outcomes and recognition. " +

HACCT have used the past 12 months to re-evaluate how the carnival is organised and delivered. A new team has been empowered to deliver Carnival 2020. The Huddersfield Carnival Management Committee (CMC) have carried out surveys online and face to face at local events in June 2019. The data captured through this source has been broken down and analysed by the 2 evaluation officers. This has allowed us to understand the requirements of the community. Almost 100 surveys were completed and the results confirm that returning to Greenhead Park is a key issue for some of the most committed and interested participants in Carnival.    Concerns about security are mentioned by a significant proportion with some giving it as a reason for no longer attending.  Please see attached report on the survey for further details. " +
